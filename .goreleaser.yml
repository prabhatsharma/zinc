    summary: Zinc Search engine. A lightweight alternative to elasticsearch.
    description: |
      Zinc is a search engine that does full text indexing. It is a lightweight
      alternative to elasticsearch and runs in less than 100 MB of RAM. It uses
      bluge as the underlying indexing library.

      It is very simple and easy to operate as opposed to elasticsearch which
      requires a couple dozen knobs to understand and tune.

      It is a drop-in replacement for elasticsearch if you are just ingesting
      data using APIs and searching using kibana (Kibana is not supported with
      zinc. Zinc provides its own UI).
