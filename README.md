‚ùóNote: If your use case is of log search (app and security logs) instead of app search (implement search feature in your application or website) then you should check [zinclabs/zincobserve](https://github.com/zinclabs/zincobserve) project that is specifically built for observability use case.
# ZincSearch

ZincSearch is a search engine that does full text indexing. It is a lightweight alternative to Elasticsearch and runs using a fraction of the resources. It uses [bluge](https://github.com/blugelabs/bluge) as the underlying indexing library.

It is very simple and easy to operate as opposed to Elasticsearch which requires a couple dozen knobs to understand and tune which you can get up and running in 2 minutes

It is a drop-in replacement for Elasticsearch if you are just ingesting data using APIs and searching using kibana (Kibana is not supported with zinc. Zinc provides its own UI).

Check the below video for a quick demo of Zinc.

# Playground Server

You could try ZincSearch without installing using below details: 

|          |                                        |
-----------|-----------------------------------------
| Server   | https://playground.dev.zincsearch.com  |
| User ID  | admin                                  |
| Password | Complexpass#123                        |

Note: Do not store sensitive data on this server as its available to everyone on internet. Data will also be cleaned on this server regularly.

# Why ZincSearch

  While Elasticsearch is a very good product, it is complex and requires lots of resources and is more than a decade old. I built Zinc so it becomes easier for folks to use full text search indexing without doing a lot of work.

# Features:

1. Provides full text indexing capability
2. Single binary for installation and running. Binaries available under releases for multiple platforms.
3. Web UI for querying data written in Vue
4. Compatibility with Elasticsearch APIs for ingestion of data (single record and bulk API)
5. Out of the box authentication
6. Schema less - No need to define schema upfront and different documents in the same index can have different fields.
7. Index storage in disk (default), s3 or minio (deprecated)
8. aggregation support
